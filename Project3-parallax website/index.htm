        <h2>PLANT&TREES</h2>
        <P><b>Trees </b>have been with us throughout our whole lives. They re the background of a favorite memory and that welcome patch of green our eyes seek as we gaze out our windows an activity we are doing a lot these days.While they are silent and stationary, trees hold tremendous powers, including the power to make all our lives better and healthier.<br> If a tree has power, a forest has even more.Forests do this by removing pollutants and sediments from rainfall and then slowly releasing the water back into waterways and underground aquifers. Thanks to trees, this naturally cleaner water is easier and cheaper to treat before it ends up in your tap. The water supply is also steadier because all of the rainwater didnâ€™t end up in a river right away; it seeped through these natural filters over time.</P>

        <h2>Flowers</h2>
        <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.<br>

            Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.</p>

        <h2>Lake and Mountain</h2>
        <P><b>Mountain</b>, landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes, a relatively confined summit area, and considerable local relief. Mountains generally are understood to be larger than hills, but the term has no standardized geological meaning. Very rarely do mountains occur individually. In most cases, they are found in elongated ranges or chains.<br> <b>A lake </b>is a naturally occurring, relatively large body of water localized in a basin completely surrounded by dry land,[1] with much slower-moving flow than any inflow or outflow streams that serve to feed or drain it.[2] Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form part of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing pools of storage water. Most lakes are freshwater, but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater.</P>
